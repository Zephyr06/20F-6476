<p>This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image formation, camera imaging
    geometry, feature detection and matching, stereo, motion estimation and tracking, image classification and scene
    understanding. We'll develop basic methods for applications that include finding known models in images, depth
    recovery from stereo, camera calibration, image stabilization, automated alignment, tracking, boundary detection,
    and recognition. The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and
    then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the projects.</p>
